# leaflet-challenge: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

This repository contains the following:

### Part 1:

  * A street map containing data points for all earthquakes in the last 7 days.

  * The data points are coloured based on the depth of the earthquake, which can be seen in the legend.

  * The data points are sized based on the magnitude of the earthquake.

  * When clicked on the pop ups provide detail on the location, magnitude and depth of the earthquake.

  * An additional layer can be selected to view tectonic plates.
